## Building a Serverless Apache Kafka Data Pipeline

Serverless services allow us to build applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. This allows developers to avoid provisioning, scaling, and managing resource utilization. In this workshop we will build a serverless data pipeline using Amazon MSK Serverless which enables data to be consumed from many different client applications to accomplish downstream tasks such as dashboards and analytics.
